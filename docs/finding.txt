To flash the stm with a new binary:
    st-flash --reset write <binary_name.bin> 0x8000000 

About RCC:
    RCC: Reset and Clock Controller 
        It's a peripheral module responsible for managing the clock sources, clock frequencies, and reset control for various parts of the microcontroller.
        It's what provides clock signals and control for the CPU, peripherals, and memory systems within the STM32.
    
    AHB: Advanced high Performance
    APB: Advanced Peripheral

    2 configurable AHB buses:
        high-speed APB (APB2) max (100 MHz)
        low-speed APB (APB1) max (50 MHz)

    To main sources for the PLL:
        HSE: High Speed External 4-to-26 MHz crystal oscillator
        HSI: High Speed Internal 16 Mhz 

PWM and Timers:
    PWM is a wave. We can create this with a specific frequency.
        Period
            the number at which the start of pulse up to the next start of the pulse
        Duty cycle:
            percentage of when its high and low

        A period can be the same but the duty cycle can be different.

Simplest Bootloader:
    Bootloader: 
        is the first code that will run to init and load the next program
        sometimes in an unmodifiable ROM
        Loads and/or jumps to the next code to run
        somtimes verifies the code to be run
        
Arm:
    arm-none-eabi-objdump -D <elf file> > asm-dump

UART Driver:
    Uart is a serial protocol.
    No clock line
    Start bit and a stop bit.
    10 bits: 2 bit for start and stop and 8 bits of data data.
    Can have a parity bit.

    Baud rate = bit periods /second
    For a baud rate of 115200:
    E.G:
        11520 bytes / seconds (~11.5 KiB/S)
        Full firmware image: 480 KiB
        Max transfer time: ~42 seconds
